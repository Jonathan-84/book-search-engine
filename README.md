# Google Book Search 

  ## Description 
  Reading can be fun, but unless you have a book series you follow, it can be difficult finding your next best read. You can use this app to quickly search and save books you want to read. While this application is quicky and easy to use, it posed the challenge of being the first ful blown MERN app that I created without "training wheels".

  ## Contribute
  This app in it's current state is very limited. While I could add more saved lists, I wanted to avoid duplicating another one of my projects. That said, if you had ideas I'd love to hear them and work with you to improve this project. You can reach me at the email address below. One area where I may seek to improve this project, would be creating a more unique appearance using NPM packages.
